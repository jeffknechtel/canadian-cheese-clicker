# The Great Canadian Cheese Quest - Frequently Asked Questions

## Gameplay Basics

### What is The Great Canadian Cheese Quest?
The Great Canadian Cheese Quest is a free-to-play browser game that combines idle clicker mechanics with JRPG-style combat. You click a cheese wheel to produce curds, automate production with generators, recruit heroes, and battle across Canada's 13 provinces and territories.

### How do I play?
1. Click the cheese wheel to produce curds
2. Spend curds on generators to automate production
3. Purchase upgrades to boost your output
4. Recruit heroes and form a party
5. Battle enemies and bosses in each province
6. Prestige to unlock new content and multipliers

### What are curds?
Curds are the primary currency. You earn them by clicking the cheese wheel or through automated generators. Use curds to purchase generators, upgrades, and hero equipment.

### What is CPS (Curds Per Second)?
CPS represents your automated curd production rate from all generators combined. Higher CPS means faster progression even when you're not actively clicking.

### How do generators work?
Generators automatically produce curds over time. Each generator type has a base production rate and cost that increases with each purchase. Upgrades can multiply their effectiveness.

## Heroes and Combat

### How do I recruit heroes?
Heroes are recruited as you progress through the game. Some unlock automatically at certain milestones, while others are found through exploration or special events. Check the Heroes panel to see available and locked heroes.

### How does combat work?
Combat uses an Active Time Battle (ATB) system:
1. Each hero and enemy has an ATB gauge that fills over time
2. When a hero's gauge is full, you can select an action
3. Basic attacks, abilities, and items are available
4. Strategic timing and ability usage determine victory

### What is a party?
Your party consists of up to 4 heroes that participate in combat. You can change party composition between battles. Consider balancing roles: Tank, DPS (damage), Healer, and Support.

### How do abilities work?
Each hero has unique abilities that consume resources or have cooldowns. Abilities range from powerful attacks to healing and buffs. Some abilities have synergies with other heroes.

### What happens if I lose a battle?
If all heroes fall in combat, you're returned to the zone map. There's no permanent penalty - your heroes recover fully and you can retry or choose a different battle.

## Prestige System

### What is the prestige system?
The prestige system allows you to reset progress in exchange for permanent multipliers and new content. There are three tiers:
1. **Aging**: Reset generators for Golden Rennet
2. **Vintage**: Reset Aging progress for Aged Curds
3. **Legacy**: Reset Vintage progress for Master Rennet

### When should I prestige?
A good rule of thumb is to prestige when your potential reward is significantly higher than your current multiplier. The game shows your potential gains before confirming.

### What do I keep after prestige?
- Heroes and their experience (Aging tier)
- Certain achievements
- Crafted cheeses in collection
- Prestige currencies and their upgrades

### What do I lose after prestige?
- Current curds
- Generator quantities
- Most upgrades (some persist based on tier)
- Combat zone progress

## Crafting and Cheeses

### How does crafting work?
1. Collect ingredients from generators or combat
2. Select a recipe you've unlocked
3. Combine ingredients to create cheese
4. Optionally age cheese in caves for enhanced effects

### What do cheeses do?
Crafted cheeses provide buffs when equipped:
- Production bonuses
- Combat stat increases
- Special effects unique to each cheese

### What are aging caves?
Aging caves allow you to mature cheese over time for stronger effects. Different caves have different aging rates and bonus types. Premium caves unlock through prestige.

### How do I unlock recipes?
Recipes unlock through:
- Reaching certain zones
- Achieving milestones
- Completing achievements
- Prestige progression

## Provinces and Zones

### How do zones work?
Each of Canada's 13 provinces/territories contains multiple zones with enemies and bosses. Defeat enemies to progress through zones and unlock the next province.

### What are boss battles?
Bosses are powerful enemies at the end of zone sequences. They have multiple phases with unique mechanics. Defeating bosses unlocks new provinces and rewards.

### Do I need to complete zones in order?
Generally yes, though some zones may unlock early through achievements or events. The main progression follows a path through the provinces.

## Saving and Loading
