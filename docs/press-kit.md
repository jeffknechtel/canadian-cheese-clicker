The Great Canadian Cheese Quest is a unique blend of idle clicker and JRPG gameplay. Build your cheese production empire, recruit legendary Canadian heroes, and battle mythological bosses across all 13 provinces and territories. Sorry not sorry, eh!

### Long Description
The Great Canadian Cheese Quest combines the addictive progression of idle clickers with strategic JRPG combat. Start by clicking a cheese wheel to produce curds, then automate your production with Canadian-themed generators like Maple Syrup Taps and Hockey Stick Churners.

Recruit over 30 unique heroes inspired by Canadian folklore, from the legendary Lumberjack to the mystical Wendigo Hunter. Each hero brings unique abilities to your party as you battle through 13 provinces, facing mythological bosses from First Nations legends and Canadian culture.

Master a three-tier prestige system: Age your cheese for Golden Rennet, become a Vintage collector with Aged Curds, and ultimately achieve Legacy status with Master Rennet. Each tier unlocks new mechanics, heroes, and content.

Craft over 50 authentic Canadian cheese recipes, equip your heroes with legendary gear, and participate in seasonal events celebrating Canada Day, Poutine Week, Hockey Season, and Winterlude.
